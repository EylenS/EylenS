# Welcome! :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:

Hi! My name is **Eylen Sánchez** ☺️ 
I guess you want to know a little about me 😉. Briefly, I have a master's degree in food science and engineering 👩‍🔬. I worked 💼 for a while in the food industry in different sectors of the food industry 🍗 🥖 🍯 🍫, but always in the area of research and development 🥰. This prompted me to do my postgraduate studies with the purpose of learning about the different techniques and analytical tools in food science research 🔭 📑. 

Some time ago I heard about the new methodologies used for self-learning in technology offered by Holberton, I got excited, applied, passed and finished the foundation programme 👩‍💻. 

It makes me very excited to think of all that I can still learn and all that technology has to offer, but most of all, to think that I can integrate my learning in software development into science, research and engineering applied to sustainable food ❤️‍🔥.
